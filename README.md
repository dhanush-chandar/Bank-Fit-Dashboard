# BankFit Dashboard (Power BI) — Canadian Banks Comparison (2023–2025)

A Power BI dashboard that compares major Canadian banks across **profitability**, **operational efficiency**, and **risk** using a transparent composite scoring method called **BankFit Score**.

This report is designed to be **stakeholder-friendly**: quick to interpret, interactive, and structured for analysis (overview → trends → drill-through deep dive).

---

## What This Report Answers

- Which bank looks strongest overall based on selected priorities (**Balanced / Growth / Safety**)?
- How do key KPIs change **quarter-over-quarter** across banks?
- What does a single bank’s **efficiency vs return tradeoff** look like over time?
- Where are bank branches distributed across the **Toronto (GTA)** area?

---

## KPIs Used

| KPI | Meaning | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| **Net Income ($M)** | Profitability | Higher is better |
| **ROE (%)** | Shareholder return | Higher is better |
| **Efficiency Ratio (%)** | Operating efficiency | **Lower is better** |
| **PCL ($M)** | Credit risk exposure | **Lower is better** |

> Note: The dashboard uses **averages** for ratio KPIs (ROE, Efficiency Ratio) and **totals** where appropriate for scale-dependent metrics (Net Income, PCL), depending on the page context.

## BankFit Score (How Ranking Works)

**BankFit Score** is a composite index that ranks banks using a weighted combination of the KPIs above.

High-level approach:
1. KPI values are **normalized** to allow fair comparison across banks.
2. Metrics where **lower is better** (Efficiency Ratio, PCL) are **inverted** during scoring.
3. A weighted score is calculated based on the selected **Profile**.

### Profile Logic
- **Balanced:** equal weight to profitability, efficiency, and risk  
- **Growth:** higher weight on **Net Income & ROE**, lower penalty for risk  
- **Safety:** higher penalty for **PCL** and stronger emphasis on efficiency

> The goal is not “absolute truth,” but a **consistent, explainable ranking** aligned to different decision priorities.
